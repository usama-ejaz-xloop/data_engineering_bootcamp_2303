# Assignment 6.3

Implement tests for `tasks/6_writing_robust_readable_and_maintainable_code/day_3_testing/assignment/my_proj` project (there is a `tests/test_sum_func.py` file ready, missing the tests only).

Aim for 100% code coverage, branch coverage and condition coverage. Run the tests with `pytest`. Run the tests with a flag producing coverage reports (you'll need to install [`pytest-cov`](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/)).
